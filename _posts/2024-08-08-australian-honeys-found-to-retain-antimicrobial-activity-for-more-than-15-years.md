Honey’s reputation for longevity is legendary, epitomized by the discovery of edible honey in the tomb of Egyptian king Tutankhamun, preserved for over 3,000 years. Our latest research reveals another dimension of honey’s endurance: its remarkable antimicrobial properties can endure for decades. Examining a collection of active Australian honeys, we found that the majority maintained significant antimicrobial activity for an impressive 15+ years. This finding is significant because it suggests that honey could be a viable option for long-term storage and therapeutic use.

The Burden of Expired Medicines
All medicines have a shelf life, and the issue of expired medicines is a growing concern. In Australia, despite a free returned medicine scheme, many medicines are still disposed of inappropriately or kept in households well beyond their expiry date. This is particularly problematic for antimicrobials, as improper disposal can lead to environmental contamination and the use outside of prescribed need and expiration date can lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance. Natural products with antimicrobial activity could mitigate such risks, with a promising option being medicinal honey.

Ancient Remedy, Modern Solution
As a non-toxic natural product, medicinal honey does not pose an environmental risk. It also appears incapable of inducing antimicrobial resistance thanks to its multiple active mechanisms which work together to inhibit microbial growth. Our research has now shown that, with proper storage, the antimicrobial properties of honey have incredible longevity over a timeframe of 15+ years. These properties highlight the therapeutic potential of honey to offer a natural and sustainable alternative for combating microbial infections.

What Makes Honey such a Durable Healer? 
The resilience of honey as a healer lies in its inherent physical properties and complex chemical composition. Sugars, organic acids, enzymes, and other bioactive compounds all work together synergistically to inhibit microbial growth. We found these longevity properties to be consistent across a diverse range of honeys from native flora including apple box, banksia, jelly bush, paperbark, red stringybark, tea tree, yellow box and more. While storage conditions play a crucial role in maintaining these properties, honey’s inherent stability sets it apart as a unique antimicrobial remedy.

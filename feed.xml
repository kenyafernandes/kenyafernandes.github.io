Currently, the lack of well-defined parameters for assessing these properties presents a significant challenge to the Australian honey industry in developing the antimicrobial honey market. Our recently published study set out to address this challenge, aiming to identify key factors influencing the antimicrobial activity of honey and provide practical ways for the industry to assess these. We profiled the antimicrobial properties of a diverse collection of 30 Australian honeys, analysing how various physical and chemical traits align with antimicrobial activity against different microbes.</p> <p>The need for a direct microbiological test Using statistical models, we determined the predictive capacity of various chemical and physical properties on antimicrobial activity. In manuka honey, most antibacterial activity is due to methylglyoxal (MGO), making a simple chemical test of MGO concentration sufficient to replace microbiological testing. Non-manuka honeys present a more complex challenge. We found that combining factors like hydrogen peroxide levels, antioxidant content, and water activity improved predictive capabilities compared to considering any single factor alone, but our models still did not reach very high confidence. These findings highlight the multifaceted nature of honey’s bioactivity and indicate that direct microbiological measurement of antimicrobial activity will remain the best strategy for the industry in terms of both accuracy and simplicity.</p> <p>The phenol test vs the minimum inhibitory concentration test In Australia, the current industry standard for measuring antimicrobial activity is the phenol equivalence assay, which is an agar diffusion-based assay. The phenol equivalence assay has significant drawbacks including difficulty interpreting the results, variability between laboratories, reliance on one microorganism, and the water-based agar matrix preventing the free diffusion of some potentially bioactive compounds. Our study argues that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, which is a broth-based assay, provides superior results. The MIC assay can be applied to a wide variety of microbes including bacteria, yeasts, and moulds, is not affected by diffusion-issues, and is the gold standard research method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We propose that the MIC assay is a superior method for testing the antimicrobial activity of honey and where possible should replace the phenol equivalence assay as the industry standard.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An article for the Professional Beekeepers website.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Australian honeys found to retain antimicrobial activity for more than 15 years</title><link href="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/australian-honeys-found-to-retain-antimicrobial-activity-for-more-than-15-years/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Australian honeys found to retain antimicrobial activity for more than 15 years"/><published>2024-08-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/australian-honeys-found-to-retain-antimicrobial-activity-for-more-than-15-years</id><content type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/australian-honeys-found-to-retain-antimicrobial-activity-for-more-than-15-years/"><![CDATA[<p>Honey’s reputation for longevity is legendary, epitomized by the discovery of edible honey in the tomb of Egyptian king Tutankhamun, preserved for over 3,000 years. Our latest research reveals another dimension of honey’s endurance: its remarkable antimicrobial properties can endure for decades. Examining a collection of active Australian honeys, we found that the majority maintained significant antimicrobial activity for an impressive 15+ years. This finding is significant because it suggests that honey could be a viable option for long-term storage and therapeutic use.</p> <p>The Burden of Expired Medicines All medicines have a shelf life, and the issue of expired medicines is a growing concern. In Australia, despite a free returned medicine scheme, many medicines are still disposed of inappropriately or kept in households well beyond their expiry date. This is particularly problematic for antimicrobials, as improper disposal can lead to environmental contamination and the use outside of prescribed need and expiration date can lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance. Natural products with antimicrobial activity could mitigate such risks, with a promising option being medicinal honey.</p> <p>Ancient Remedy, Modern Solution As a non-toxic natural product, medicinal honey does not pose an environmental risk. It also appears incapable of inducing antimicrobial resistance thanks to its multiple active mechanisms which work together to inhibit microbial growth. Our research has now shown that, with proper storage, the antimicrobial properties of honey have incredible longevity over a timeframe of 15+ years. These properties highlight the therapeutic potential of honey to offer a natural and sustainable alternative for combating microbial infections.</p> <p>What Makes Honey such a Durable Healer? The resilience of honey as a healer lies in its inherent physical properties and complex chemical composition. Sugars, organic acids, enzymes, and other bioactive compounds all work together synergistically to inhibit microbial growth. We found these longevity properties to be consistent across a diverse range of honeys from native flora including apple box, banksia, jelly bush, paperbark, red stringybark, tea tree, yellow box and more. While storage conditions play a crucial role in maintaining these properties, honey’s inherent stability sets it apart as a unique antimicrobial remedy.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An article for the Professional Beekeepers website.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Microbial allies in honey bee hives</title><link href="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/microbial-allies-in-honey-bee-hives/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Microbial allies in honey bee hives"/><published>2024-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/microbial-allies-in-honey-bee-hives</id><content type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/microbial-allies-in-honey-bee-hives/"><![CDATA[<p>Bees pollinate crops with which we feed our world, making healthy and stable honey bee colonies crucial for global agriculture and ecosystems. However, bee populations are facing unprecedented challenges from pesticides, diseases, and degraded landscapes. For World Honey Bee Day 2024, Kenya Fernandes explores how understanding the relationships between bees and their commensal microbes can provide insights into new ways to support and protect our essential pollinators. #MicrobiologyEvents</p> <p>The microbial ecosystem of bee hives For bees, a hive is much more than a cozy home. Honey bees transform their hives into complex environments and fill them with unique products like honey, beeswax, pollen, and propolis. Each of these bee products plays a crucial role in the colony’s health and functioning.</p> <p>Even though many enjoy the sweetness of honey, it actually provides essential energy for bees. Similarly, propolis – a sticky substance made from plant resins and beeswax – acts as a protective sealant, fortifying the hive against potential invaders.</p> <p>As bees interact with flowers and soils in the environment, they also introduce microbes into their hives. The bacteria, yeasts, and moulds interact with the hive’s products, the bees, and each other, shaping different microbial niches and thus a dynamic microbial ecosystem.</p> <p>The microbial interactions help bees maintain a healthy and functional hive environment, as shown in the research article “Pollen products collected from honey bee hives experiencing minor stress have altered fungal communities and reduced antimicrobial properties” in FEMS Microbiology Ecology.</p> <p>Microbes contribute to honey and pollen production When forager bees collect nectar from flowers, it is rather susceptible to degradation due to the absence of antimicrobial mechanisms and the high water content. As bees transform nectar into honey, bacteria and yeasts thrive, producing natural antimicrobial compounds including antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, and other compounds that contribute to honey’s protective properties.</p> <p>So, even though mature honey is a supersaturated sugar solution, it deters microbial growth. This allows bees to store it long-term in the hive for times when food is scarce.</p> <p>For honey production, the impact of microbes seems indeed rather small. Yet, the study showed that microbes, and particularly fungi, are important for developing the functional properties of pollen and the resulting “bee bread”.</p> <p>Bee bread is the primary protein source for adult and baby bees. For this, bees mix the freshly collected pollen with glandular secretions, containing various enzymes, peptides, and proteins, as well as small amounts of nectar or honey. They then store the mix in wax combs.</p> <p>Over time, bacteria and yeasts ferment the pollen mix in the combs producing bee bread. Fungi, in particular, can reach high densities in bee bread and likely enhance its nutritional benefits compared to raw pollen. This inhibits the growth of harmful microorganisms and preserves the bee bread.</p> <p>The bee gut microbiome impacts bee health For the health of the bees and thus for the fermentation process, the microbial community living in bee guts plays a crucial role. This honey bee gut microbiome is dominated by five core bacterial lineages that evolved with bees for tens of millions of years: Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, Lactobacillus Firm 4, Lactobacillus Firm 5, and Bifidobacterium.</p> <p>These microbes contribute to digesting food, absorbing nutrients, detoxifying harmful substances, and protecting against pathogens. Hence, a healthy bee gut microbiome is crucial for maintaining a bee’s overall metabolic health.</p> <p>This also means that disrupting the bee gut microbial community from environmental stress, diseases, or poor nutrition can compromise bee health and colony stability. Factors like pesticides, antibiotics, and poor foraging conditions can lead to microbial imbalances, weakening the bees’ immune systems and increasing their vulnerability to diseases.</p> <p>Understanding the role of the gut microbiome in bee health is essential to help bees resist diseases and pollinate crops. Protecting and nurturing bee populations is thus key to ensuring both the stability of our food supply and the health of natural ecosystems.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An article for the FEMS Microbiology blog.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</title><link href="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra"/><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra</id><content type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024[[read-time]] min read We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

The antimicrobial properties of honey are well-established in the context of human health, but fewer studies have connected this to bee health. Although floral source, geographic location, and environmental conditions are typically studied to understand honey activity, it is important to recognise that the bees themselves contribute antimicrobial components like peptides and enzymes to honey, and that their foraging behaviour also determines what kinds of nectar become honey.</p> <p>The Impact of Hive Stress and Honey Activity With increasing threats and stressors affecting honey bee populations, understanding the full range of impacts of hive stress on bees and their hive products is crucial.</p> <p>In a recent study conducted at the University of Sydney, our research group investigated the antimicrobial and chemical properties of honey from healthy hives and hives experiencing signs of stress including low populations, queenlessness, and signs of disease. These hives were located in the same apiary, assuming consistent climatic factors and access to identical floral resources.</p> <p>Our findings revealed a significant difference in antimicrobial activity, with healthy hive honey exhibiting higher activity than stressed hive honey. This difference was attributed to variations in the chemical composition of the honey, particularly to increased levels of phenolics and antioxidants in healthy hive honey, compounds that contribute to its antimicrobial potency.</p> <p>Understanding the Role of the Microbiome The bee gut and hive environment house diverse microbial communities, collectively known as the microbiome. These microbes assist in digestion, detoxification, and immune function.</p> <p>Under stressful conditions, the microbiome can become destabilised, compromising bee and hive health. To evaluate microbial dynamics, we compared bacterial and fungal populations in the bee gut and hive environment between healthy and stressed hives.</p> <p>Our results showed that stressed hives had more diverse bacterial and fungal communities compared to healthy hives indicating an impaired ability to prevent microbial overgrowth. Differences observed in the abundance of key plant-associated microbes in the bee gut between healthy and stressed hives also suggested potential differences in foraging behaviour.</p> <p>Implications for Beekeepers Taken together, these results suggest that healthy hives are producing honey with increased antimicrobial activity and therefore an increased ability to prevent microbial growth in the hive environment, likely feeding back into maintaining hive health. These findings highlight the importance of understanding and proactively managing honey bee health for beekeepers as even seemingly minor stressors can have implications for overall hive fitness and the economic potential of hive products. By ensuring bees have access to high-quality nutrition and minimising stressors such as pesticide exposure, beekeepers can contribute to the production of high-quality honey and the long-term success of honey bee colonies.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An article for the Professional Beekeepers website.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Australian ant honey inhibits tough pathogens, new research shows</title><link href="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2023/australian-ant-honey-inhibits-tough-pathogens-new-research-shows/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Australian ant honey inhibits tough pathogens, new research shows"/><published>2023-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2023/australian-ant-honey-inhibits-tough-pathogens-new-research-shows</id><content type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2023/australian-ant-honey-inhibits-tough-pathogens-new-research-shows/"><![CDATA[<p>The medicinal value and potent antimicrobial activity of honey has been a topic of considerable interest in recent years, particularly in light of the alarming rise in antibiotic resistance.</p> <p>While most honey comes from honey bees (Apis mellifera), other insects such as stingless bees, wasps and even ants can produce honey-like products from plant nectar.</p> <p>One of these insects is the honeypot ant Camponotus inflatus, found throughout the central desert region of Australia. We set out to determine whether its honey might be medically useful.</p> <p>Our results, published in PeerJ, show the honey has powerful anti-microbial effects, particularly against certain heat-tolerant yeasts and moulds which resist most current antifungal drugs.</p> <p>Pots of gold Honeypot ants are social ant species that develop large nests in the soil. Within these colonies, certain worker ants known as “repletes” serve as living food stores.</p> <p>The repletes are fed by other members of the colony, who forage for nectar and honeydew in the environment. The repletes accumulate a golden honey-like substance in their flexible abdomens.</p> <p>In times of need, other worker ants visit the repletes and stroke their antennae. The repletes cough up some honey in response, and the other workers then distribute it throughout the colony.</p> <p>Most honeypot ants live in very dry environments. Their unusual lifestyle has been so successful it has evolved multiple times.</p> <p>Honeypot ants in First Nations culture</p> <p>In Australia, Camponotus inflatus is found throughout the central desert region and holds cultural and nutritional significance to local Indigenous people.</p> <p>Danny Ulrich of the Tjupan language group, operator of Goldfields Honey Ant Tours in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, says</p> <p>For our people, honey ants are more than just a food source. Digging for them is a very enjoyable way of life. It’s a way of bringing the family together, to connect with each other and nature.</p> <p>There are also reports of traditional use of honeypot ant honey for treating ailments like colds and sore throats, and possibly as a topical ointment to help keep infections at bay, suggesting potential antimicrobial properties.</p> <p>Not your usual honey activity To investigate further, we obtained honeypot ant repletes from Goldfields Honey Ant Tours, collected and pooled the honey from the ants and tested its ability to inhibit various pathogenic bacteria, yeasts and moulds.</p> <p>We compared this to two well-studied bee honeys with anti-microbial properties: manuka honey from New Zealand, and jarrah honey from Western Australia.</p> <p>Our results revealed striking differences between the honeypot ant honey and the bee honeys.</p> <p>Both bee honeys showed broad activity and were able to inhibit every pathogen tested at similar levels. However, the honeypot ant honey showed remarkable potency against certain microbes, but little against others.</p> <p>Important factors that contribute to the antimicrobial power of bee honey are its high sugar and low water content, which sucks the water out of microbial invaders.</p> <p>We found honeypot ant honey to have a much higher moisture content than the bee honeys, however, putting it in a range that could support the growth of some microorganisms.</p> <p>Most bee honeys also contain enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide, a known antimicrobial compound. However, honeypot ant honey retained most of its activity even after we removed all the hydrogen peroxide.</p> <p>Finally, some honeys contain antimicrobial proteins and peptides that are derived from the honey bee. These can be destroyed by heat, and when we heated the honeypot ant honey to 90°C for 10 minutes it lost most of its antimicrobial activity.</p> <p>We therefore think this unique antimicrobial activity is likely due to proteins or peptides, and these are probably derived from the honeypot ant.</p> <p>Evolution of antimicrobial activity in the insect world In the natural environment, animals, plants, and the products they make are exposed to a huge range of microorganisms looking for their next meal. Sweet, nutritious honey is an enticing food source for these microbial scavengers and must be vigorously protected, both to prevent its spoilage and to stop invasion of the hive or nest by rapidly growing moulds.</p> <p>Intriguingly, we found honeypot ant honey was particularly effective against some pathogens we consider to be quite “tough”. These pathogens are well adapted to living in soils and dry conditions, and can also cause very serious infections in people with severely weakened immune systems.</p> <p>In particular, the ant honey was able to inhibit heat-tolerant yeasts and moulds that are likely to be present in the honey ant nest and surrounding environment. Importantly, these can be very difficult to kill with most currently available antifungal drugs.</p> <p>We suggest the evolutionary pressure imposed by these soil microorganisms has resulted in the potent, selective antimicrobial activity of honeypot ant honey.</p> <p>Science catches up with Indigenous knowledge Our results clearly support the medicinal use of honeypot ant honey by Australian Indigenous communities and provide a new understanding of the intricate relationship between honeypot ants, their environment, and the remarkable antimicrobial activity exhibited by their honey.</p> <p>Due to the cultural significance of the ants, and challenges with rearing them at a commercial scale, it is not feasible to domesticate honeypot ants for honey production.</p> <p>However, honeypot ant honey may provide valuable insights for the development of useful new antimicrobial peptides. These may help expand our arsenal of effective antibacterial and antifungal treatments, which are increasingly needed to combat emerging challenges in healthcare.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An article for The Conversation.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How honey contributes to bee and hive health</title><link href="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/how-honey-contributes-to-bee-and-hive-health/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How honey contributes to bee and hive health"/><published>2022-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/how-honey-contributes-to-bee-and-hive-health</id><content type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/how-honey-contributes-to-bee-and-hive-health/"><![CDATA[<p>Honeybees have an amazing ability to process and store nectar in the form of honey, which plays a fundamental role in maintaining colony health. Honey consumption has far-ranging impacts on nutrition, resilience to pathogens, toxin tolerance, bee longevity, developmental regulation, immunity, and stress response. Beekeeping practices that substitute sugar solutions for honey may provide the hive with general nutrition, but this could have consequences on numerous aspects of bee and hive health.</p> <p>Nutrition &amp; Storage Honey is the main source of energy for bees to carry out their day-to-day activities. Being able to store honey protects the hive from nectar shortages when foraging is not possible due to the season or the weather.</p> <p>An individual bee may forage from only one or a few floral sources. However, at the level of the colony and over a whole season, a wide range of nectars can be collected, processed, and stored as honey providing a more consistent diet across the colony.</p> <p>Incredibly, the ability to store various products in the hive including honeys, resins, and pollen, is thought to allow bees to adapt their food source and behaviour based on the health status of individuals or the needs of the colony in order to manage health challenges.</p> <p>Antimicrobial Mechanisms Honey has a vast suite of antimicrobial mechanisms. These have mainly been investigated in relation to their benefit to humans, however they have obviously evolved to protect honey, bees, and the hive from microbial attack.</p> <p>These antimicrobial mechanisms can be broadly categorised into those that work when the honey is undiluted, or when it is diluted with water. When honey is undiluted, the high sugar content, low water, and acidic pH all contribute to the antimicrobial mechanisms and act to prevent spoilage during storage and prolong its life in the hive.</p> <p>When honey is diluted, hydrogen peroxide and other compounds derived from nectar and bee secretions contribute significantly to the antimicrobial mechanisms. Ensuring protection of diluted honey is essential to the hive as nurse bees dilute honey with water before feeding it to larvae and adults because of its high viscosity.</p> <p>Other Ecological Benefits Honey has many other properties that enhance bee health and protect the hive against various stresses. Honey plays a role in the detoxification of nectar – there are many potentially toxic chemicals collected in nectar that are neutralised by enzymes as the honey is ripened. Consumption of honey has been shown to enhance tolerance to other ingested toxins, both natural and synthetic, including mycotoxins produced by some fungi, and various pesticides and insecticides.</p> <p>Aging in bees is associated with oxidative damage, and there are various antioxidants in honey which protect bees from this damage preventing premature aging and enhancing bee longevity. Studies have shown that some plant-derived chemicals in honey can influence developmental pathways meaning that honey potentially plays a role in caste determination.</p> <p>Various components of honey are involved in stress response and particularly, promoting cold tolerance in bees during overwintering.

Honey is not a generic substance, and rather there is considerable variation between the taste, colour, aroma, and medicinal properties of honeys from different floral sources, regions, colonies, and apiaries. Honeys are extremely complex mixtures of up to 200 different substances and components of honey responsible for antimicrobial effects can originate from bee secretions, nectar and pollen foraged from plants, and associated microbes, and are often specific to particular varieties of honey.</p> <p>High Sugar &amp; Low pH Honey is a supersaturated sugar solution, making it unfavourable for microbial growth. The high concentration of sugar means that water is unavailable for microbes to use and the high osmotic pressure actively draws water out of them. Honey contains over thirty organic acids including gluconic, acetic, citric, formic, lactic, and malic acids, which contribute to a low pH which generally ranges from around 3.2 and 4.5 for different honeys. This acidic pH is inhibitory to many pathogenic microbes.</p> <p>Bee-Derived Compounds Hydrogen peroxide is the main source of antimicrobial activity in most honeys. It destroys microbes by causing oxidation of their proteins and DNA. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by the enzyme glucose oxidase, which is added to honey from the salivary glands of bees during the ripening of nectar into honey. The glucose oxidase is activated when water is added, resulting in hydrogen peroxide production. The level of hydrogen peroxide depends on the floral variety of the honey, as well as its age and how it has been processed and stored.</p> <p>Honey can contain several antimicrobial peptides that are part of the bee immune system and are also secreted into the honey. Bee-defensin-1, also known as royalisin, has activity against a wide range of bacterial pathogens including the bacteria responsible for European Foulbrood. Major royal jelly protein-1 is the most abundant protein in both royal jelly and honey, and breaks down into smaller antimicrobial peptides.</p> <p>Plant-Derived Compounds These encompass numerous diverse compounds and one of the most well-known ones is methylglyoxal (MGO). MGO comes from dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which is a naturally occurring phytochemical found in the nectar of flowers of certain Leptospermum species native to New Zealand and Australia (often referred to as “manuka”). MGO develops as a honey with nectar containing DHA ages, and the MGO plays a significant role in the antimicrobial activity of Leptospermum honeys.</p> <p>Among other plant-derived components associated with antimicrobial activity are secondary metabolites such as polyphenols, flavonoids, volatile compounds, and alkaloids. Most of these, however, are found at concentrations that aren’t sufficient to account for significant antimicrobial activity and are thought to work in combination with other compounds in honey.</p> <p>Microbiota-Derived Compounds Microbiota means a collection of microbes; this could be all the microbes that live in the nectar taken from plants, in the bee gut, or in the honey itself. Recent studies show that honey can contain a huge variety of compounds produced by these microbes, some of which likely impact its activity. These microbes are also likely to play a significant role in the breakdown and digestion of other compounds in the honey, which could enhance or neutralise a honey’s functional properties.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An article for the Professional Beekeepers website.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[<h3>External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</h3> <p>If you prefer publishing blog posts on medium.com or other external sources, starting version v0.5.0, <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> lets you to display your external posts in the blog feed of your website! 🎉🎉</p> <p>Configuring external sources of super simple.

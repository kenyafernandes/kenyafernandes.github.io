type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024[[read-time]] min read We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

Honey consumption has far-ranging impacts on nutrition, resilience to pathogens, toxin tolerance, bee longevity, developmental regulation, immunity, and stress response. Beekeeping practices that substitute sugar solutions for honey may provide the hive with general nutrition, but this could have consequences on numerous aspects of bee and hive health.</p> <p>Nutrition &amp; Storage Honey is the main source of energy for bees to carry out their day-to-day activities. Being able to store honey protects the hive from nectar shortages when foraging is not possible due to the season or the weather.</p> <p>An individual bee may forage from only one or a few floral sources. However, at the level of the colony and over a whole season, a wide range of nectars can be collected, processed, and stored as honey providing a more consistent diet across the colony.</p> <p>Incredibly, the ability to store various products in the hive including honeys, resins, and pollen, is thought to allow bees to adapt their food source and behaviour based on the health status of individuals or the needs of the colony in order to manage health challenges.</p> <p>Antimicrobial Mechanisms Honey has a vast suite of antimicrobial mechanisms. These have mainly been investigated in relation to their benefit to humans, however they have obviously evolved to protect honey, bees, and the hive from microbial attack.</p> <p>These antimicrobial mechanisms can be broadly categorised into those that work when the honey is undiluted, or when it is diluted with water. When honey is undiluted, the high sugar content, low water, and acidic pH all contribute to the antimicrobial mechanisms and act to prevent spoilage during storage and prolong its life in the hive.</p> <p>When honey is diluted, hydrogen peroxide and other compounds derived from nectar and bee secretions contribute significantly to the antimicrobial mechanisms. Ensuring protection of diluted honey is essential to the hive as nurse bees dilute honey with water before feeding it to larvae and adults because of its high viscosity.</p> <p>Other Ecological Benefits Honey has many other properties that enhance bee health and protect the hive against various stresses. Honey plays a role in the detoxification of nectar – there are many potentially toxic chemicals collected in nectar that are neutralised by enzymes as the honey is ripened. Consumption of honey has been shown to enhance tolerance to other ingested toxins, both natural and synthetic, including mycotoxins produced by some fungi, and various pesticides and insecticides.</p> <p>Aging in bees is associated with oxidative damage, and there are various antioxidants in honey which protect bees from this damage preventing premature aging and enhancing bee longevity. Studies have shown that some plant-derived chemicals in honey can influence developmental pathways meaning that honey potentially plays a role in caste determination.</p> <p>Various components of honey are involved in stress response and particularly, promoting cold tolerance in bees during overwintering. Understanding the diverse functional properties of honey has far-ranging implications for bee and hive health as well as management by beekeepers.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An article for the Professional Beekeepers website.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The many antimicrobial components of honey</title><link href="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/the-many-antimicrobial-components-of-honey/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The many antimicrobial components of honey"/><published>2022-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/the-many-antimicrobial-components-of-honey</id><content type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/the-many-antimicrobial-components-of-honey/"><![CDATA[<p>Interest in the antimicrobial activity of honey continues to grow. Honey is not a generic substance, and rather there is considerable variation between the taste, colour, aroma, and medicinal properties of honeys from different floral sources, regions, colonies, and apiaries. Honeys are extremely complex mixtures of up to 200 different substances and components of honey responsible for antimicrobial effects can originate from bee secretions, nectar and pollen foraged from plants, and associated microbes, and are often specific to particular varieties of honey.</p> <p>High Sugar &amp; Low pH Honey is a supersaturated sugar solution, making it unfavourable for microbial growth. The high concentration of sugar means that water is unavailable for microbes to use and the high osmotic pressure actively draws water out of them. Honey contains over thirty organic acids including gluconic, acetic, citric, formic, lactic, and malic acids, which contribute to a low pH which generally ranges from around 3.2 and 4.5 for different honeys. This acidic pH is inhibitory to many pathogenic microbes.</p> <p>Bee-Derived Compounds Hydrogen peroxide is the main source of antimicrobial activity in most honeys. It destroys microbes by causing oxidation of their proteins and DNA. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by the enzyme glucose oxidase, which is added to honey from the salivary glands of bees during the ripening of nectar into honey. The glucose oxidase is activated when water is added, resulting in hydrogen peroxide production. The level of hydrogen peroxide depends on the floral variety of the honey, as well as its age and how it has been processed and stored.</p> <p>Honey can contain several antimicrobial peptides that are part of the bee immune system and are also secreted into the honey. Bee-defensin-1, also known as royalisin, has activity against a wide range of bacterial pathogens including the bacteria responsible for European Foulbrood. Major royal jelly protein-1 is the most abundant protein in both royal jelly and honey, and breaks down into smaller antimicrobial peptides.</p> <p>Plant-Derived Compounds These encompass numerous diverse compounds and one of the most well-known ones is methylglyoxal (MGO). MGO comes from dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which is a naturally occurring phytochemical found in the nectar of flowers of certain Leptospermum species native to New Zealand and Australia (often referred to as “manuka”). MGO develops as a honey with nectar containing DHA ages, and the MGO plays a significant role in the antimicrobial activity of Leptospermum honeys.</p> <p>Among other plant-derived components associated with antimicrobial activity are secondary metabolites such as polyphenols, flavonoids, volatile compounds, and alkaloids. Most of these, however, are found at concentrations that aren’t sufficient to account for significant antimicrobial activity and are thought to work in combination with other compounds in honey.</p> <p>Microbiota-Derived Compounds Microbiota means a collection of microbes; this could be all the microbes that live in the nectar taken from plants, in the bee gut, or in the honey itself. Recent studies show that honey can contain a huge variety of compounds produced by these microbes, some of which likely impact its activity. These microbes are also likely to play a significant role in the breakdown and digestion of other compounds in the honey, which could enhance or neutralise a honey’s functional properties.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An article for the Professional Beekeepers website.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https:/kenyafernandes.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[<h3>External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</h3> <p>If you prefer publishing blog posts on medium.com or other external sources, starting version v0.5.0, <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> lets you to display your external posts in the blog feed of your website! 🎉🎉</p> <p>Configuring external sources of super simple.

I investigate the biology and ecology of microbial pathogens and avenues for their treatment, with an emphasis on fungal pathogens. In the space of ecology, my work focuses on interactions between bees and microbes and the impact of these relationships on pollinator, ecosystem, and human health. In the space of drug discovery and characterisation, I work on developing novel antifungal agents that work synergistically with currently used drugs and am particularly interested in sourcing compounds from natural products.

Outside the lab, I'm passionate about making science accessible and engaging for everyone. I enjoy sharing my discoveries with the public and raising awareness about our unique native species. My goal is to inspire curiosity, foster a love of science, and encourage action to protect our rich native biodiversity.

I’m a microbiologist studying how microbes shape the health of our environment, pollinators, and even humans. My research explores how bees and microbes interact and what that means for pollinator survival, ecosystems, and food security. I also work on finding new ways to fight fungal infections, especially by discovering natural compounds that can enhance existing treatments. I’m particularly interested in honey - its antimicrobial and medicinal potential, and its deep connection to bee health.

Beyond the lab, I’m passionate about making science exciting and accessible to everyone. I love sharing my discoveries, engaging with the public, and raising awareness about Australia’s incredible native species. Through storytelling and outreach, I hope to inspire people to appreciate and protect our rich biodiversity.
